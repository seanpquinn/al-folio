Welcome! I'm an experimental astro-particle physicist working on the [General Antiparticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/) cosmic ray experiment. I joined Rene Ong's group at UCLA in 2018 and am 
involved in designing and building the time of flight system, serving as the main electronics lead.

Research interests
------
My interests can be roughly partitioned into three main efforts: (1) design and construction of particle detectors with a focus on data acquisition systems, electronics and associated simulations for cosmic ray 
physics (2) calibration and comparative studies of surface detectors used by super giant arrays studying cosmic rays at the highest energies and (3) the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays through the 
cosmic environment and deflections by astrophysical magnetic fields.
